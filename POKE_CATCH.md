This will teach you how to check for message edits, send slash commands and applying button pressing. Use this with caution as you may be banned on the target bot.

The bot should take a while to start due to how it handles cooldowns. If this worked, your bot should run `/pokemon` ten times every hour, and also run `/pokestop` every three hours. Thanks again [@StrawberryChemical95](https://github.com/StrawberryChemical95) for the submission.
