# Discord Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the unofficial Discord documentation for user account automation, AKA self-bots. This repository is not affiliated with Discord. **Discord self-bots are against TOS and may get you banned.**

## Fundamentals

Discord self-bots have been around for a while. They aim to automate tasks on Discord, whether to create chaos or to advance in economy bots. There are other uses, such as spamming and phishing. While I won’t directly cover spamming on Discord, you might figure it out after reading this guide.

## Starting

### Goals

- **For simple self-bots that avoid CAPTCHA**: Use `discord.py-self`. This library is reliable but may trigger CAPTCHA for certain actions.
- **For more advanced self-bots (e.g., token generators, server joiners)**: Consider the following resources:
  - [Python TLS](https://github.com/FlorianREGAZ/Python-Tls-Client/)
  - [GoLang TLS](https://github.com/bogdanfinn/tls-client)
  - [CClient](https://github.com/x04/cclient)
  - [ChromeDP](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp)

  GoLang is generally preferred for creating human-like bots due to Python's limitations in this area.
