# Discord Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the unofficial Discord documentation for user account automation, AKA self-bots. This repository is not affiliated with Discord. **Discord self-bots are against TOS and may get you banned.**

## What are self-bots

Discord self-bots automate actions that either wouldn't be possible as an official bot, or would be limited. This also includes other aspects of Discord automation, such as account creators, server joiners, etc.
